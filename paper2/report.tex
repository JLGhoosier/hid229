    With the development of the Internet, information increasingly becomes an important factor in determining the success of a product. A few years ago, manufacturing and the Internet have still belonged to two different separated industries, But as the mainstream consumer groups changed from old generation to Millennial generation, and the use of computers and the establishment and application of the Internet have produced a violent shock to the traditional way of product development, thus resulting in a new product development strategy. I have to say that the relation between the manufacturing and the Internet are getting closer and closer. One of the major changes might cause by using big data as a technique to develop right product and make effective promotion strategy.

\section{INTRODUCTION}
As a successful product designer,  you should not only consider the profits and losses of the current business but also have the foresight to predict the possible profit points. In order to maintain company's competitiveness for a long time, the enterprise must continue to grow and develop. According to past experience, the enterprise should get more profits to keep the growth. For some big company, it's easy to analyze what's working and what's not working, because they have a lot of past experience and data to analysis when they make the decision. With these data, they can create new promotions. 
In the past, if people want to predict whether a program was feasible or not, they had to go through the above process. Gain experience through a variety of failed or successful projects. It is safe to say that this approach has greatly increased the difficulty of developing new products and has also made start-up business only be a choice for the few people with the good financial or social status. Because not everyone has enough data to discover new consumer needs and has enough money to pay the huge cost to get the information. On the other hand, Generation changing in consumer groups have also brought some tremendous impact on product development. The difference between Millennial generation and Baby Boomers is enormous. And big data can play a big role in this area. Big data can dramatically reduce the cost which people used to spend on collecting data and use an intuitive way to told the product developers what changes have been happened to their consumers. These advantages are even more apparent in the area of software development.

\section{Big Data's advantages in reducing the cost}
With the development of the Internet, people are making data every moment. increasing quite quickly at a phenomenal rate. people always say we are in the era of big data but actually the real difference between now and before is just the change in the source of data, before the advent of the Internet, most of the past data was generated inside the enterprise and most of them were structured data, so In the past, large enterprises generally used the RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) to manage the data, this system is suitable for dealing with some data which is growing in an extremely slow way. so these companies do not have motivation or demand to process the data. with the emergence and rapid development of the Internet, especially the development of the mobile Internet, coupled with the large-scale use of various digital devices, the type of data is no longer just a simple structured data, these companies have to face more complex data types and faster changed customer psychology. Outdated decisions and information are bound to create disadvantages when competing with other companies, but the traditional data processing system is obviously not suitable for the era of big data. Corporate decision-makers must adopt new technologies to face the changes of the times and customer. For example, Hadoop technology is a new and widely accepted technology.
\begin{itemize}

  \item ``Hadoop is an open-source software framework for storing data and running applications on clusters of commodity hardware. It provides massive storage for any kind of data, enormous processing power and the ability to handle virtually limitless concurrent tasks or jobs.''
\end{itemize}
Adoption of new technologies brings not only higher efficiency but also lower costs.
\subsection{CHANGING IN TIME COST}
There are a lot of data, but usually, most of them are useless, only a small part of the data has the value. Collecting more data, the phenomenon will be more obvious, that is to say, irrelevant data growth rate is much higher than the growth of related data Speed. This also is a common phenomenon when we have large amounts of data. And the big data technique is used to deal with this new situation.
how to clean the data and find useful data more quickly in product development is even more important.Quickly identify the characteristics of the target customers and their possible needs for a variety of products. base on the analysis, we can develop some products that more suitable for marketplace needs, or we can be more accurate when we try to find our potential target customer. According to different consumer behavior, we can design different software, for example, during the financial turmoil we found that lots of users are price sensitive, we can design a kind of software that can provide local discount merchandise information in real time.If the target customer is a group which wants higher quality of life, we can push more high value-added product.
\section{Big Data in Application operation}
As we said before, the Millennial generation are very different from the baby boomers generation in terms of lifestyle and values. as a consequence, product designers should have different tactics for our product when we meet so many differences. The Millennial generation like to use the electronic mobile devices more frequently, and they are more willing to share their daily life on the Internet. These acts will undoubtedly produce a lot of information, produce useful data and timely data analysis will become extremely important in the future market.

For example, one of the most common problem in Machine learning is Catastrophic forgetting, as we all know the machine learning need learning from the enormity of data and create a model. Catastrophic forgetting means the model will completely and abruptly forget previously learned information upon learning from some new data sets. If we want to achieve artificial general intelligence, then machine learning must be able to be used to perform multiple tasks. Even we can use representation learning and transfer learning to help us solve this problem to a certain extent but still has significant performance degradation.
Another problem for machine learning is the safety. If we want to apply machine learning in peopleâ€™s daily life. The security will be a question which the Data scientist unable to avoid. For example, in an image recognition test, ``starting with an image of a panda, the attacker adds a small perturbation that has been calculated to make the image be recognized as a gibbon with high confidence''\cite{Ophir}.
Another problem might raise because of the type of data sets. There are several different types of data in the Big Data area. The original unlabeled data and labeled data. the labeled will highly increase the efficiency of the process when the model starts to learning. Also, it will make the model more accurate when they do recognition. But the fact is even though the data increasing quite quickly at a phenomenal rate, with 2.5 quintillion bytes a day. but most of these data are unlabeled, which means these data are useless for supervised learning. and it also not suitable for deep learning which is the subset of machine learning.
\section{Applications in Machine Learning}
With the development expands and skills improved, machine learning becoming more popular and accepted by a lot of areas. Machine learning has been widely applied in data mining, computer vision, Natural Language Processing, biometrics, search engines, medical diagnosis and detection of credit card fraud, securities market analysis, DNA sequencing, speech and handwriting recognition, strategy games and robotics areas.
\subsection{Machine learning in data mining}
Data mining has been influenced by many disciplines, including database, machine learning, and statistics. To put it crudely, databases provide data management techniques, machine learning and statistics provide data analysis techniques.Many techniques provided by the statistical areas usually need further develop in the machine learning field, and then become effective machine learning algorithms before they can enter the field of data mining\cite{Margaret01}.Statistics affects data mining through machine learning, while machine learning and database are two major supporting technologies of data mining.
\subsection{Machine learning in recommendation system}
One of most common application in machine learning area is the recommendation system which running on the different Big internet company. Amazon may be taken as a typical example of the recommendation system. Based on a user's shopping record and a lengthy wish list, identifies which of the products the user is really interested in and willing to buy. Such a decision model can help the company to provide advice to customers and boost product consumption. for example, when you Log on to Facebook or GooglePlus, and they recommend the user who might be associated with you or you might know\cite{Bernard01}.
\subsection{Machine learning in Marketing Personalization}
According to the behavior pattern of the user during the free trial and the behavior in the past, which users might change to be a premium user, and which will not?. Such a decision model can help the company intervene in the program to convince users to pay sooner or better participate in product trials. For example, most of the video website and streaming media provider are willing to give user a free trial which can collect the user information and produce more attractive video or series to increase the user base\cite{Bernard01}.
\section{Conclusion}
Big data and machine learning are the two most popular fields in the Information Technology area. From the middle evil times' blocking of information to the explosion of data now, the amount of data in various fields and the scale of data sets have been increased at a phenomenal rate. The huge volume of data has brought huge potential opportunities and changes. With the proper use of the machine learning in big data can produce a lot of advantage. such as improve the efficiency. we can use the advantage of these data to help us make a better decision in different fields. one of a good example in scientific research is the data-driven research. In the scientific research, we can use the big data of the search engine to predict the ability widely used in the fields of medicine, astronomy and so on
